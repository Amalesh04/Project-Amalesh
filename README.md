**Objective**

The projects uploaded in here are various fundamental concepts and skills related to working with various databases for operations such as: i. Creating databases and tables, ii. Inserting and manipulating data, iii. Querying and filtering data, Aggregating and analyzing data, and iv. Data manipulation and transformation.

**Project 1: Academic Management System ( using SQL)**

Project Description: Design and develop an Academic Management System using SQL. The Aim is to create a system that allows for managing student information and course enrollment. The projects should involve:

    Database creation,
    Inserting values into the tables,
    Retrieve the Student Information, and
    Reporting and Analytics (Using joining queries)

**Project 2: Student Database Management System(PostgreSQL)**

Project Description: Design and implement a student database management system using PostgreSQL that allows storing and retrieving student information efficiently. The project will include the following tasks:

    Database Setup,
    Inserting values into the tables,
    Student Information Retrieval,
    Query for Male Students,
    Query for Students with GPA less than 5.0,
    Update Student Email and Grade,
    Query for Students with Grade "B",
    Grouping and Calculation,
    Table Renaming, and
    Retrieve Student with Highest GPA.

**Project 3: Event Management System using PostgreSQL**

Project Description: To develop the application that allows users to create and manage events, track attendees, and handle event registrations efficiently. The project will include the following tasks:

    Database Setup,
    Inserting values into the tables,
    Manage Event Details (Insert, update & Delete),
    Manage Track Attendees & Handle Events (Insert & register an attendee for an event), and
    Develop queries to retrieve event information, generate attendee lists, and calculate event attendance statistics.

**Project 4: OLAP Operations (using Redshift or PostgreSQL)**

Project Description: Perform OLAP operations (Drill Down, Rollup, Cube, Slice, and Dice) on the "sales_sample" table to analyze sales data. The project will include the following tasks:

    Database Setup,
    Inserting values into the tables,
    Perform OLAP operations such as: 3.1: Drill down - To drill down from region to product level to understand sales performance 3.2: Rollup - To perform roll up from product to region level to view total sales by region 3.3: Cube - To explore sales data from different perspectives, such as product, region, and date 3.4: Slice - To view sales for a particular region or date range 3.5: Dice - To view sales for specific combinations of product, region, and date
